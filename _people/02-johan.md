His research is focused on better understanding the uncertainties in air-sea flux measurements from small autonomous sailing vehicles and quantifying the role of submesoscale changes in air-sea fluxes and its impacts on the mean flux. Johan is supervised by myself and Sebastiaan Swart and collaborting with Sarah Gille and Matt Mazloff.
