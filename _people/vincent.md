Vincent is a PhD student in physical oceanography, focusing on fine-scale ocean dynamics using observational techniques. His research spans the Agulhas Current system, as part of the WHIRLS project, and the Southern Ocean as part of the SO-CHIC project. Among others, his goal is to understand how fine-scale dynamics impact larger-scale circulation.
