The aim of Gonzalo's masters is to investigate the respective role of ocean versus atmospheric drivers of CO2 flux variability in the Cape Basin using Wave Glider observations and CO2 reconstruction products. He is working with Sebastiaan Swart, Sarah Nicholson from SOCCO, and myself, and is linked to the QUICCHE project.
