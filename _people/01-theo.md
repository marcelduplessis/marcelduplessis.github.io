Theo's thesis is focused on understanding the characteristics, distribution, and variability of Antarctic Winter Water and its links to upper ocean temperature and sea ice variability. His recent paper entitled [The observed spatiotemporal variability of Antarctic Winter Water](https://essopenarchive.org/users/745508/articles/722799-the-observed-spatiotemporal-variability-of-antarctic-winter-water) used ~600,000 CTD hydrographic profiles from 45°S across the circumpolar Southern Ocean from 2004-2021 ([link to dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10258138)), including Argo, MEOP, SOCCOM, and WOD18 data (ship-based CTD and gliders) to show that Winter Water displayed specific overturning pathways connecting the subpolar ocean to the global ocean that can be explained by ocean-topography interactions.

Theo is a PhD student under the supervision of Sebastiaan Swart and myself, collaborating with Alexander Haumann at the Alfred Wegner Insitute. Theo is passionate about climate change, graduated from the University of Exeter with a Master of Mathematics where he studied geophysical (and some astrophysical) fluid dynamics (thesis on overturning ocean circulation and Stommel’s box model under Prof. Geoffrey Vallis).
