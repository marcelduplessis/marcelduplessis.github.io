Vincent is focusing on fine-scale ocean dynamics using observational techniques. His research spans the Agulhas Current system, as part of the WHIRLS project, and the Southern Ocean as part of the SO-CHIC project. Among others, his goal is to understand how fine-scale dynamics impact larger-scale circulation. He is currently working on understanding the role of submesoscale processes and synoptic atmospheric forcing dyanmics on changes in the mixing of the subpolar Southern Ocean from glider observations.
