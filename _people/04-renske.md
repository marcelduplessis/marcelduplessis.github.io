Renske's Masterâ€™s thesis focuses on analysing the vertical ventilation pathways in the Cape Basin from Apparent Oxygen Utilization from glider observations, and incorporates several satellite data products such as DUACS and SWOT. Her goal is to understand the pathways of transport from the surface to ocean interior in the turbulent eddy rich Cape Basin associated with the QUICCHE project. Her supervisors are Sebastiaan Swart and myself.
