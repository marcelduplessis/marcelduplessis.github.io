Johan has previously completed both a B.Sc and a double M.Sc. under the supervision of Sebastiaan, Marcel, and Sarah Nicholson looking to quantify the role atmospheric rivers on the surface buoyancy in the Southern Ocean. In 2019 he joined the SCALE Spring Cruise to the Southern Ocean, deploying buoyancy gliders, Wave Gliders, buoys, both in water and on the ice! He spent his childhood in the archipelago just south of Gothenburg, fishing, tinkering with boat engines, and solving everyday problems around the house. This has led to an intense curiosity for the ocean, what makes it work, and an interest in building things, from decks and stairs, to concrete roads, or small boats from scraps.
