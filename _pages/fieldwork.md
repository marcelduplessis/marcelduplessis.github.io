## Going to sea

For me, going out into the ocean and deploying equipment, taking measurements, and feeling the waves is both a lot of fun and exciting, but it is also an honour to contribute to the growing expanse of data that we need to understand the ocean's role in climate variability and change. 

I have been fortunate enough to have nmerous experiences going to sea on research vessels, mainly to waters around Antarctica. Here, I have experienced giant storms, freezing sea ice, stunning wildlife, and many other unique experiences.
