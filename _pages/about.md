Hi, I'm a physical oceanographer in the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg. 

My main research interest is the ocean's role in climate. My goal is to improve our basic understanding of how physical ocean flow dynamics and air-sea interactions - such as atmospheric storms and ocean eddies - move climate-relevant properties, such as heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide, between the atmosphere, surface ocean, and ocean interior. I use observational data from autonomous ocean robotics, including gliders, profiling floats, and uncrewed surface vehciles, combined with remotely sensed satellite data and numerical ocean-atmosphere models. 

## Opportunities
We are offerring a PhD position to start in late 2025 / early 2026 on *Investigating the impact of fine-scale ocean and atmosphere dynamics in the Southern Ocean on air-sea heat and CO2 exchange*. You can find the advert here.

## Current projects
- PI on Vetenskapsr√•det (VR) / Swedish Research Council Establishment Grant funded 2025-2028 on [How understanding storms reduces Southern Ocean heat and CO2 uptake uncertainty](https://www.gu.se/en/research/how-understanding-storms-reduces-southern-ocean-heat-and-co2-uptake-uncertainty)
- Research Scientist on ERC Synergy Project [WHIRLS](www.whirls.eu).

## Positions
- Researcher, University of Gothenburg
- Co-chair of [Southern Ocean Flux Working Group](https://soos.aq/activities/cwg/soflux) of the Southern Ocean Observing System
- Co-lead FAIR Data Task Team of [Observing Air-Sea Interaction Strategy (OASIS)](www.airseaobs.org)

## Research interests
`Air-sea interactions`; `Submesoscale dynamics`; `Atmospheric mesoscale systems`; `Autonomous ocean observations`
