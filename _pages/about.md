Hi, I'm an oceanographer/climate scientist in the [Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper). I have been working within the [Polar Gliders](www.sebswart.com) team since 2020, when I moved to Sweden from my home country South Africa. 

In 2023, I completed a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101032683/reporting) working with Sebastiaan Swart and the SO-CHIC EU Horizon 2020 project and before that I had a Postdoctoral Fellowship with Sarah Nicholson at [Southern Ocean Carbon-Climate Observatory](http://socco.org.za/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Ocean & Atmopsheric Sciences at the [University of Cape Town](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-oceanography) in 2018 working on understanding the role of submesoscale processes on mixing in the Southern Ocean. 

In addition to my research responsbilities, I am also the co-chair of the [Southern Ocean Observing System air-sea fluxes (SOFLUX)](https://soos.aq/activities/cwg/soflux) and co-lead for the [FAIR data, models, and products task team](https://airseaobs.org/FAIR-data) of the [Observing Air-Sea Interactions Strategy (OASIS)](https://airseaobs.org/) UN Decade Programme.

My research
======
My main research interest is the ocean's role in climate. My goal is to contribute to improved knowledge on the movement of climate-relevant properties, such as heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide, between the atmosphere and ocean. In particular, I study the processes responsible for regulating upper ocean physical flow dynamics and air-sea interactions, such as atmospheric storms and ocean eddies. I mainly use observational data from autonomous ocean robotics, including gliders, profiling floats, and uncrewed surface vehciles, and I combine these data with remotely sensed satellite data and numerical ocean-atmosphere models. 

Opportunities
======
I will soon advertise for a PhD position within the Polar Gliders research team as a part of my Vetenskaprådet (Swedish Research Council) grant "How understanding storms reduces uncertainties in Southern Ocean heat and CO2 uptake". More details coming soon...
