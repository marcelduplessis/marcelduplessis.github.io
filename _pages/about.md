I am a research scientist with the [Polar Gliders](www.sebswart.com) team in the [Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper). Before this I completed a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101032683/reporting) with Sebastiaan Swart at the University of Gothenburg. Prior to that I did a Postdoctoral Fellowship with Sarah Nicholson at [Southern Ocean Carbon-Climate Observatory](http://socco.org.za/). In 2018, I completedmy  Ph.D. in Ocean & Atmopsheric Sciences at the [University of Cape Town](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-oceanography) in 2018 working with Isabelle Ansorge and Sebastiaan Swart, who was at SOCCO at the time.

In addition to my research responsbilities,I am also the co-chairof the [Southern Ocean Observing System air-sea fluxes (SOFLUX)](https://soos.aq/activities/cwg/soflux) and co-lead for the [FAIR data, models, and products task team](https://airseaobs.org/FAIR-data) of the [Observing Air-Sea Interactions Strategy (OASIS)](https://airseaobs.org/) UN Decade programme.

Research
======
My main research interest is to study the ocean's role in climate. Over the last decades, the ocean has [absorbed 90% of the extra heat](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/1675/2023/) and [26% of carbon dioxide](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/5301/2023/) created by increased greenhouse gas emissions. My goal is to study the processes that allow this to occur by reasearching the upper ocean physical flow dynamics and air-sea interactions. I mainly use data from autonomous ocean robotics, including gliders, profiling floats, and uncrewed surface vehciles. I combine these data with remotely sensed satellite data and numerical ocean-atmosphere models.
