Hi, I'm a physical oceanographer in the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg. 

My main research interest is the ocean's role in climate. My goal is to improve our basic understanding of how physical ocean flow dynamics and air-sea interactions - such as atmospheric storms and ocean eddies - move climate-relevant properties, such as heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide, between the atmosphere, surface ocean, and ocean interior. I use observational data from autonomous ocean robotics, including gliders, profiling floats, and uncrewed surface vehciles, combined with remotely sensed satellite data and numerical ocean-atmosphere models. 

## Research interests
`Air-sea interactions`; `Submesoscale dynamics`; `Mid-latitude cylones`; `Ocean heat and CO2 uptake`; `Autonomous ocean observations`

## Opportunities
- We will be offering a 3-year Postdoc and a 4-year PhD position as part of the SOFIA Project, starting around mid-to-late 2026. Reach out if you would like to be kept in the loop.


## Current projects
- PI on European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant funded 2026-2031. Project: [Southern Ocean Fine-Scale Interactions with the Atmosphere (SOFIA)](https://www.gu.se/en/news/erc-starting-grant-to-research-on-southern-oceans-critical-climate-function)
- PI on Vetenskapsr√•det (VR) / Swedish Research Council Establishment Grant funded 2025-2028. Project: [How understanding storms reduces Southern Ocean heat and CO2 uptake uncertainty](https://www.gu.se/en/research/how-understanding-storms-reduces-southern-ocean-heat-and-co2-uptake-uncertainty)
- Research Scientist on ERC Synergy Project [WHIRLS](www.whirls.eu).

## Positions
- Researcher, University of Gothenburg
- Co-chair of [Southern Ocean Flux Working Group](https://soos.aq/activities/cwg/soflux) of the Southern Ocean Observing System
- Co-lead FAIR Data Task Team of [Observing Air-Sea Interaction Strategy (OASIS)](www.airseaobs.org)
- OASIS Steering Committee
