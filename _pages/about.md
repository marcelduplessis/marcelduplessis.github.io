I'm a physical oceanographer in the [Department of Marine Sciences](https://www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper), University of Gothenburg. I work with the Polar Glider Research Group, where I study how the ocean interacts with the atmosphere and how these exchanges shape the weather and climate we experience. My research focuses on the physical processes that move climate-relevant properties—such as heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide—between the atmosphere, the ocean surface, and the deep ocean. This work is motivated by the ocean’s crucial role in absorbing much of the excess heat and CO₂ produced by human greenhouse gas emissions. 

I use data collected by autonomous ocean robots—including gliders, profiling floats, and uncrewed surface vehicles—alongside satellite observations and numerical ocean–atmosphere models. By combining these approaches, my team and I investigate how short-term weather patterns influence climate variations over years to decades.

    <h3>Johan Edholm (PhD)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Johan’s primary interest lies in air-sea interactions, ranging from local, small-scale effects to broad, global implications. He focuses on the autonomous technologies that allow us to observe these interactions from the coast to the open ocean.
    <br><br>
    Privately, he enjoys quality time with friends and family, whether that means enjoying good music and fine dining or playing board games. He is also an avid traveller who enjoys exploring new cultures and seeking out new adventures.</p>

    <h3>Vincent Doriot (PhD)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Vincent examines fine-scale mixed layer dynamics from high-resolution underwater gliders. While his current work focuses on the Southern Ocean, he has plans to explore the complex processes of the Agulhas Current.
    <br><br>
    Outside of work, Vincent is passionate about music, both as a listener and a guitar player. In the warmer months, he explores nature looking for wildlife with his camera, while winter finds him at his computer playing video games.</p>

    <h3>Lovisa (MSc)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Lovisa is a masters student in Physical Oceanography at the University of Gothenburg. She is doing her one-year masters thesis with us focusing on estimating vertical velocities and vertical exchange at meso- to submesoscale fronts in the Cape Basin, using autonomous glider observations and satellite altimetry. 
    <br><br>
    Outside of her studies, she loves diving and enjoys climbing and spending time with friends. </p>
