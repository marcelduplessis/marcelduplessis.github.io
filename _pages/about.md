Hi, I'm a physical oceanographer in the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg. 

My main research interest is to reveal how the ocean, and its interactions with the atmosphere, influence the climate we live in. My goal is to improve our basic understanding of how physical ocean flow dynamics and air-sea interactions - such as atmospheric storms and ocean eddies - move climate-relevant properties, such as heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide, between the atmosphere, surface ocean, and ocean interior. I use observational data from autonomous ocean robotics, including gliders, profiling floats, and uncrewed surface vehciles, combined with remotely sensed satellite data and numerical ocean-atmosphere models. 

## Research interests
`Air-sea interactions`; `Submesoscale dynamics`; `Mid-latitude cylones`; `Ocean heat and CO2 uptake`; `Autonomous ocean observations`

## Opportunities
- As part of the SOFIA project, we will soon be advertisitng positions for a postdoc and PhD. Feel free to get in touch.


## Current projects
- PI on European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant funded 2026-2031. Project: [Southern Ocean Fine-Scale Interactions with the Atmosphere (SOFIA)](https://www.gu.se/en/news/erc-starting-grant-to-research-on-southern-oceans-critical-climate-function)
- PI on Vetenskapsr√•det (VR) / Swedish Research Council Establishment Grant funded 2025-2028. Project: [How understanding storms reduces Southern Ocean heat and CO2 uptake uncertainty](https://www.gu.se/en/research/how-understanding-storms-reduces-southern-ocean-heat-and-co2-uptake-uncertainty)
- Research Scientist on ERC Synergy Project [WHIRLS](www.whirls.eu).

## Positions
- Researcher, University of Gothenburg
