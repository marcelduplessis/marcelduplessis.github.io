*Most of the extra heat trapped by human-made greenhouse gases doesn’t stay in the atmosphere — the ocean absorbs about 93% of it. SOFIA aims to uncover what regulates this heat uptake so we can understand and predict its changes in the future.*

Among the world’s oceans, the Southern Ocean plays an outsized role. It acts like a vast heat sponge, taking up as much as 75–83% of the total heat stored by the global ocean. Yet, despite its importance, we still struggle to agree on exactly how and why this region is so effective at absorbing heat. Climate models can disagree by as much as 40%, largely because they don’t capture the fine-scale winds, eddies, and turbulent motions that dominate these waters.

**The SOFIA project aims to uncover the key physical processes that move heat between the atmosphere, the ocean surface, and the deep ocean in the stormy Southern Ocean.** My research explores two main questions: how powerful storms drive the exchange of heat between air and sea, and how swirling ocean fronts, eddies, and narrow filaments transport that heat into the ocean interior.

To tackle these challenges, I combine **cutting-edge coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations** with new in-situ observations collected by **autonomous robotic platforms** in one of the most remote parts of the planet. I also use data from ESA’s **Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite** to map vertical ocean motion across the entire Southern Ocean.

Together, these efforts will build a clearer and more predictive understanding of how the ocean regulates Earth’s climate — knowledge that’s essential for improving future climate projections.

**Funding:** 4.4m SEK

*This project explores how storms affect the exchange of heat and carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere in the harsh and rapidly changing environment of the Southern Ocean. We want to understand how storms interact with small-scale ocean motions and sea ice to shape these exchanges and, in the process, improve the formulas used to describe them in climate models.*

Our goal is to make climate projections more accurate by **combining existing observations** with **new, cutting-edge measurements**. Using data from the only year-round Southern Ocean Flux mooring, I’ll study how storms drive changes in ocean heat and carbon uptake from one season to the next.

I’ll also be part of the **Pulse of the Weddell Sea Expedition**, where we’ll deploy autonomous instruments such as **Wave Gliders, Sailbuoys, and ocean-profiling gliders** to measure how the ocean and atmosphere interact in icy regions. Working closely with international collaborators, these efforts will give us a rare, detailed view of ocean conditions during extreme weather events.

To complement these field observations, we’ll use **high-resolution satellite** data from the **Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)** mission, which provides unprecedented detail on ocean currents and sea ice patterns. Together, these tools will help us reveal how storms and small-scale ocean movements influence Earth’s climate system.

Finally, we’ll use what we learn to **improve the models that simulate heat and carbon exchange between the ocean and atmosphere**. By reducing uncertainty in how we represent these processes, we hope to strengthen future weather forecasts and global climate projections — and highlight the growing power of autonomous ocean observing systems.
