# Community 

## Current Panels
---
- **OASIS UN Decade Program Steeting Committee (2025 - present)** <br> I am a steering committee member for the [Observing Air-Sea Interaction Strategy (OASIS)](www.airseaobs.org) Group. I also sit on the Grand Idea 1: Global In Situ Array: Connecting the Parts as ECOP co-lead, and co-load the FAIR Data Task Team.

- **SUN Fleet Science Committee (2025 - present)** <br> I am on the science committee team of the newly-formed Emerging Network of the Global Ocean Observing System called [Surface Uncrewed Network (SUN) Fleet](https://airseaobs.org/sun-fleet). Our focus is to foster collaboration, streamline data and technology standards, and promote best practices in deployment, operations, and data sharing for uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs).

- **Southern Ocean Flux Capability Working Leadership Group (2023 - present)** <br> I am part of the leadership team for [SOFLUX](https://soos.aq/activities/cwg/soflux), a [Southern Ocean Observing System](https://www.soos.aq/) (SOOS) Capability Working Group focused on advancing coordinated air–sea flux observations to improve our understanding and quantification of momentum, heat, and gas exchanges in the Southern Ocean.
