<small><b>(Left figure)</b> Satellite image of swirling phytoplankton blooms acting as tracers to the highly energetic flows of the Southern Ocean with a 3D slice of a strain-induced submesoscale front. <b> (Right figure)</b> Schematic of the coupled air-sea processes responsible for air-sea and upper ocean heat exchange, and how these will be sampled via the field plan. Recent SWOT satellite estimates of mesoscale strain rates shows the much finer detail on ocean flow to be resolved in SOFIA.<small>
