## Opportunities
---
- I will open a postdoc position within the SOFIA project in late 2026. 
- If you are interested in joining our team for student research projects, please get in touch.
- I’m also happy to support fellowship applications, such as the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), [VR International Postdoc](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/calls/2025-11-11-international-postdoc-within-natural-and-engineering-sciences-spring-call.html) (17/02 deadline), and [Carl Tryggers Postdoc](https://www.carltryggersstiftelse.se/this-is-the-carl-trygger-foundation/) (14/05 deadline). Reach out if you’d like to discuss project options.

    <h3>Johan Edholm (PhD)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Johan’s primary interest lies in air-sea interactions, ranging from local, small-scale effects to broad, global implications. He focuses on the autonomous technologies that allow us to observe these interactions from the coast to the open ocean.
    <br><br>
    Privately, he enjoys quality time with friends and family, whether that means enjoying good music and fine dining or playing board games. He is also an avid traveller who enjoys exploring new cultures and seeking out new adventures.</p>

    <h3>Vincent Doriot (PhD)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Vincent examines fine-scale mixed layer dynamics from high-resolution underwater gliders. While his current work focuses on the Southern Ocean, he has plans to explore the complex processes of the Agulhas Current.
    <br><br>
    Outside of work, Vincent is passionate about music, both as a listener and a guitar player. In the warmer months, he explores nature looking for wildlife with his camera, while winter finds him at his computer playing video games.</p>

    <h3>Lovisa (MSc)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Lovisa is a masters student in Physical Oceanography at the University of Gothenburg. She is doing her one-year masters thesis with us focusing on estimating vertical velocities and vertical exchange at meso- to submesoscale fronts in the Cape Basin, using autonomous glider observations and satellite altimetry. 
    <br><br>
    Outside of her studies, she loves diving and enjoys climbing and spending time with friends. </p>

    <h3>Neha Ramsarup (PhD)</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.7rem;">Neha explores how the dynamic Agulhas Current influences South Africa’s coastal systems, using autonomous instruments and satellites to track meanders, eddies, and upwelling events in Algoa Bay. Her work uncovers the fine-scale processes that shape the coastal environment and its ecosystems.
    <br><br>
    When she’s not working, Neha can usually be found chasing sunsets and taking photos whenever the light is just right. She also enjoys dancing and spending time with friends, especially when there’s good music and good energy</p>
