# 1. Roles and Responsibilities
---

## PI Responsibilities
--- 

As a group leader, Marcel has a unique and challenging range of responsibilities.

- **Define the research direction for the group:** Identifying the important problems is one of the hardest and most crucial aspects of scientific research. It requires an awareness of the overall state of knowledge in the field, plus creativity and plenty of luck.

- **Obtain funding:** Scientific research is expensive! A single Ph.D. student or postdocs costs more than 1 million SEK per year. A central role of the PI is to obtain grant funding to support our work, without which no research could happen.

- **Provide scientific mentoring:** It is the PI’s responsibility to help the junior members in the group develop into mature, independent scientists, capable of defining and executing their own research programs.

- **Set goals and timelines:** Marcel can help give structure to your project by defining specific milestones and timelines for their completion. Some people prefer to be closely managed in this way, while others may prefer a more hands-off approach.

- **Provide feedback:** Marcel is expected to provide feedback on all aspects of research, including defining hypotheses and formulating questions; identifying specific methods and technical approaches; identifying relevant datasets; figures and visualizations; managing data; and writing and editing papers. Feedback is also available on course selection, overall career goals, and long-term strategy through regular Individual Development Plan discussions.

- **Oversee the publication process:** Publishing research papers are the main output of our team. Marcel can help identify when results are ready to publish, select which journals to target, and help manage the ups and downs of the revision process.

- **Define the technical approach:** Software and computing are very important to our group. The PI is working hard to provide a software and hardware environment that enables everyone else to be as productive as possible.

- **Provide moral support:** Research can be an emotional roller coaster. Marcel has been through these challenges personally and is always available to listen and provide advice.

- **Provide material support:** You are never expected to spend any of your personal finances on anything related to research. All conference travel, computer supplies, books, etc. etc. can be paid for with grant or department support. These expenses should be coordinated via Marcel.

- **Provide recommendation letters:** You need them for almost every career move.

- **Scientific community service:** Marcel is expected to participate in professional organizations (e.g. SOFLUX, OASIS) and review papers and proposals on an ongoing basis.

- **Teaching:** As a researcher, Marcel may teach one or two courses per year. This can occupy a considerable fraction of available time and effort, but may also lead to intellectual growth. 

- **Do personal research:** On top of the above, believe it or not, Marcel still has his own personal research projects which he occasionally attempts to find time to work on.

One point of enumerating these responsibilities is to emphasize that the PI has a great many demands on his time, which must be managed carefully.

## Postdoc Responsibilities
--- 

Postdocs are relatively free of responsibilities and have the experience to function independently. (That’s why everyone else is jealous of postdocs.) On the other hand, they have to face the uncertainty of the job market...

- **Produce research:** As a postdoc, you're primary focus is research. Your number-one aim is to deliver new scientific discoveries!

- **Write papers:** You are expected to take the lead on writing the papers that describe your research.

- **Attend conferences:** This is a key part of getting the word out about your research. It’s your responsibility to identify conferences of interest and submit your work to them.

- **Produce reusable data / software:** In our group, we believe strongly that research is more than just papers. You are expected to share the outputs of your research (data and software) in a way that makes them reusable by the rest of the group and the rest of the field.

- **Share your expertise:** By this stage of your career, you have accrued substantial expertise in several areas. Share your knowledge by letting us know about new papers, giving feedback on others’ work at group meetings, etc.

- **Mentor others:** The more junior members of the group will benefit immensely from your mentorship, and you will gain valuable experience along the way. Take the initiative to develop these relationships.

- **Plan for the future:** A postdoc is a temporary position. Think about your career goals and make a concrete plan for obtaining your next job; we will do everything we can to support you.

- **Communicate with the group and attend group meetings.**

## PhD Responsibilities
--- 

PhD students have a complex range of responsibilities to manage. Learning to deal with it all is part of the journey. 

- **Stay in good standing:** it is YOUR responsibility to understand all of the formal requirements of the PhD programme and the department, and to stay ahead of all deadlines regarding registration, paperwork, credits, meetings, etc. The University of Gothenburg introduction to PhD course is an essential reference in this regard. So are your peers. 

- **Be professional and organized:** Develop a system that works for your for managing your responsibilities, coursework, and research. This is one of the biggest challenges of being a PhD. Unfortunately there is no formula that works for everyone.

- **Stay on top of your coursework:** The University of Gothenburg requires 60 credits to be accumulated during your PhD. You should strive to get as much as possible out of your coursework and connect it to your research wherever possible. Keep track of your credits and plan accordingly.

- **Develop independence:** Your goal is to become an independent scientist. This means you should not hesitate to pursue your own ideas as they arise. Go to as many talks as you can to learn new things! Read (and re-read, and then re-read ...) papers in your field and outside it. Download that dataset and analyze it! Run that new model! Don’t wait to be told to do things. Take the initiative.

- **Focus on your research:** Your research is the most important part of your PhD experience. It should be your main priority, and you should approach it with the seriousness and professionalism you would a full-time job (remember that the European tax-payers are shelling out about 1m SEK per year for you to have this opportunity).

- **Develop a research plan:** In consultation with your advisor, you should come up with a long-term plan for your research, with clearly defined milestones and goals. Each week, you should have a short term plan for exactly what to work on to move towards those goals.

- **Produce reusable data / software:** In our group, we believe strongly that research is more than just papers. You are expected to share the outputs of your research (data and software) in a way that makes them reusable by the rest of the group and the rest of the field.

- **Ask Questions!** If something is unclear to you–either a science question or a procedural / administrative issue–it is your responsability to speak up.

- **Communicate with the Group and attend group meetings.**

## Masters Responsibilities
--- 

We normally only accept 60 HP master's students, which is equivalent to about 9 months of research time in the University of Gothenburg model. This is your first step beyond the coursework curtain and into the research world. It can be confusing and sometimes a little daunting. 

- **Focus on your research:** Your research is the most important part of your Master's experience. It should be your main priority, and you should approach it with the seriousness and professionalism you would a full-time job. This is your opportunity to show what you can do, if you want to move on to a PhD in the future!

- **Ask Questions!** If something is unclear to you–either a science question or a procedural / administrative issue–it is your responsability to speak up.

# 2. Professional Expectations
--- 

## Vacation and working hours:

One of the great advantages of working in academia is the flexible schedule. But this flexibility can also be a curse. There is a reason why business require their employees to show up every day at nine: this is how work gets done. 

## Here are some general guidelines to help define what it means to be “at work”:

- Aim for a 40 hour work-week *on average*. Academic work often occurs in bursts. Sometimes you are happy and excited to work more hours in a week as you are on the cusp of a major breakthrough. You can balance these periods of intensity with slower-paced weeks at another time. (When taking classes, being present and assignments count towards this time, when possible try to connect course work to your research and broad understanding of Earth sciences.)

- Generally plan to be at Natrium for most of the day on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. These are when seminars and group meetings tend to be held. Being present in the office is important for building relationships with you colleagues and for the spontaneous generation of new ideas. This is also a good way to get short questions answered rapidly, so you can make agile progress.

- Be available on communication channels all business days (Monday - Friday) during business hours (9am - 5pm).

- Feel free to work remotely occasionally as it suits your personal and professional life. For example, if your family lives abroad, you may wish to spend a few weeks working from their country. This should be the exception, not the rule.

- Be clear about when you are really on vacation, as opposed to working remotely. (See section on self-care.)

- In the Swedish system, PhDs and postdocs are allocated leave in Primula. Be on top of your vacation days and log these accordingly. 

- Travel dates for vacation and non-vacation remote work must be approved by Marcel.

# 3. Communication and Meetings
--- 

## Channels:

Our group uses several channels of communication. You are expected to participate in all of them.

- Email is an unavoidable part of the modern world. All important official correspondence will happen through email. Check it regularly.

- Discord is our preferred mode of communication within the group. It’s a way to discuss things more interactively and informally than email.

- Github is where we store and discuss all things software-related. Everyone should have a github account.

## Group Meeting:

Group meetings are currently held every Monday, 9-10 AM at Natirum. Everyone should attend group meetings as much as possible. If you have a conflict which prevents you from attending, let Marcel know ahead of time.

<br>

# 4. Self Care
--- 

Your physical and mental health are crucial to your well being as a person. These should always take priority over your studies and work. Conversely, a satisfying and respectful work environment is an important factor in your mental health. Science can be an emotional roller coaster. Exams, paper reviews, fellowship applications, and job searches all involve being judged, which often causes anxiety. There is growing awareness in academia that students are at high risk for depression and anxiety. If you feel you are facing mental health challenges, don’t be ashamed – you’re not alone!

With this in mind, our group strives to do everything possible to support students and ensure a healthy work-life balance. The vacation and workload expectations defined above are a big part of this. Don’t overwork! Some other tips, based on experience, are the following:

- Maintain a healthy sleep schedule.

- Pursue interests and hobbies outside of your work. These help releive stress. They also benefit your research! Stepping away from your problem and letting your mind wander elsewhere is, counterintuitively, a great way to stimulate creative thought.

- Develop a support network among your peers. They understand the struggle!

- If you feel like you need help, don’t hesitate to contact

Anonymous or confidential reporting possibilities and contact points are described in the University’s administrative procedure and on the student/staff portals; these documents explain how cases are handled, what support is available, and the obligation of employees and managers to participate in investigations.
​

Group expectations and conduct
Our group is committed to a harassment-free and inclusive professional environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or political views. Sexual language, sexualised jokes, and sexual imagery are never appropriate in professional settings or in social activities connected to conferences, fieldwork, teaching, or research meetings.

## Respect goes beyond “not harassing” and includes:

- Being attentive to how we speak to one another and avoiding belittling, exclusionary, or hostile comments.

- Leaving space in discussions so that everyone has a genuine opportunity to participate, and being mindful not to interrupt, talk over, or dominate conversations.

- Taking feedback seriously if someone signals that a comment, joke, or behaviour felt uncomfortable or inappropriate.

## Role of Marcel du Plessis:

Within this group, Marcel du Plessis is a responsible contact person for issues related to behaviour, discrimination, and harassment in the group’s activities and events. Marcel will listen to concerns, provide information on University of Gothenburg procedures, and help you contact the appropriate unit (for example HR, student support, health and safety representatives, or other designated functions) if you wish. You are encouraged to approach Marcel as early as possible if you have any concerns, questions, or experiences related to harassment, discrimination, or victimisation in connection with the group’s work.
